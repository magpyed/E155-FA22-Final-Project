# References
The VL53L0X driver is largely sourced from ArtfulBytes' post [here](https://www.artfulbytes.com/vl53l0x-post). He receives our utmost thanks for making this driver open-source - the VL53L0X lacks documentation, and we truly did not have the time to reverse engineer the provided API. 

The source code provided to us by Prof. Brake can be found [here](https://github.com/joshbrake/E155-FA2022).
